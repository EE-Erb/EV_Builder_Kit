Due to the significant portion of greenhouse gases being emitted by the transportation sector, new methods of
reducing these emissions are being pushed forward. One of the main methods to reduce these emissions is through the
widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles, or EVs to replace carbon emitting cars. As some are skeptical of what a transportation
grid powered by electric vehicles would look like, a model that can showcase the viability and characteristics of these vehicles
would be helpful. Our model is an example of this, consisting of multiple battery operated and rechargeable cars running on a configurable track, along with various methods of recharging and monitoring the batteries. This would provide not only a running model of an electric transportation grid, but would also showcase the
characteristics of various technologies that could be used to recharge and power the vehicles of the grid as well.
